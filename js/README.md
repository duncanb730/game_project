# The Not-Frogger Project

Welcome to the not-quite-frogger zone. I've taken the original version I was given and modified it slightly. So far, it's just in size, but I'm hoping that I'll be able update the game over a period of time and improve the playability.

Until then, Enjoy!

##How to play.

It's pretty simple. Inside the game file folder, open the index.html file in your favorite browser. This was developed using Chrome, but I've tested it in Safari and Firefox and haven't had any issues so far. If you do have any problems, please let me know so I can fix it for you and any other players in the future.

##Your Character.

You are the boy with antennae. I'm not sure why you have antennae, but you do, so lets just go with that.

##The Enemy.

BUGS. Big bugs. 

####Notes.
I'm planning on making new sprites at some point in the future. Oversize ladybugs don't really seem like a truly worthwhile enemy. A tractor-trailer, sports car, pickup truck, maybe even a stylized Donald Trump or Trump supporter in a red hat would make a more believeable enemy. I suppose I could put a hat on the ladybugs. Let me check on that...

##Gameplay.

The goal is reaching the grass. You start off in the water and you have to cross the stone tiles to reach your goal. The Ladybugs will run you over on their way to a picnic. If they hit you, you start in the water again. If you reach the grass, the game resets and you go again.

You move your character using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The movements are fairly self-explanitory. Up moves you up, down moves you down, left moves left, right moves right. 

##A Bit of Advice

Move quickly. After the first few laps, the bugs get spread out and they do a pretty good job covering the road. It's never impossible, but it can get harder. The closest approximation of the recommended strategy is act like you're trying to cross the road in Bangkok, Thailand.
